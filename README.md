# Rock-paper-scissor

In this project, I implemented a rock-paper-scissors game using DOM manipulation to create an interactive and enjoyable website for users. The game is played against the computer, where the player can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random selection. If the player wins, they gain a point. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing the player to easily play the game and keep track of their score. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, and I used event listeners to handle user input and update the game state accordingly.
